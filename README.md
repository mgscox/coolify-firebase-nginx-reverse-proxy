## Environment variables

### `FIREBASE_ID`

The firebase project id (e.g. PROJECT-12345) you wish to support authentication for. The project id can be found in the firebase console under project settings.

Rather than use a .env file, it is recommended to use a coolify environment variable. Ensure BUILD option is selected when you set the variable.
